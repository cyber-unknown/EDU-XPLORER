Every year there are lakhs of students who seek admission into various colleges around the country. Often students and their parents have to travel to multiple colleges physically to view the entire flora and fauna, view the infrastructure and gather information about various courses and facilities provided by college. Some people travel from one end of country to another which is time taking and is not easy to do instantly give the fact that students have very less time for completing the admission procedure. Hence with the modern technology rapidly growing, sitting at home we can take a virtual tour of some famous places of the world.
